The goal of the program is to make use of the implementation of constants, switch statements, if/else statements, logical operators, and math functions. Creating a program in which you help a farmer named Donna manager her crops for the upcoming season. Although there will be a point in which unprecedented events lead to destroyed crops. The inputs will be whatever the user chooses to buy, and the amount wanted. The program will then output the amount bought, how many crops are left, and how much it will sell. There was a slight bit of error handling that was done to the program as per the instructions, besides that nothing else was done.
